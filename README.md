# Machine Learning Work
This repository contains my work while learning **Machine Learning fundamentals**.  
The work is organized on a **weekly basis**, covering core machine learning algorithms along with hands-on dataset handling.

## 📚 Weekly Breakdown
### Week 1: Demo of ML Packages
  - Introduction to Python ML libraries
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn basics

### Week 2: Data Preprocessing
  - Data cleaning
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling and encoding

### Week 3: Linear Regression
  - Simple and multiple linear regression
  - Model evaluation

### Week 4: Ridge and Lasso Regression
  - Regularization techniques
  - Bias–variance tradeoff

### Week 5: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Distance metrics
  - Classification using KNN

### Week 6: ID3 Decision Tree
  - Entropy and information gain
  - Decision tree construction

### Week 7: Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes
  - Binary classification
  - Probabilistic models

### Week 8: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Margin maximization
  - Kernel concepts

##🧪Practice Pattern
Each week includes **two problems**:
1. **Loading datasets** (local or built-in datasets)
2. **External datasets** downloaded from:
   - GitHub
   - Kaggle

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
